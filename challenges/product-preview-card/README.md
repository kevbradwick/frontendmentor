## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind

### What I learned

I decided to give Tailwind another go. I've always disliked how your html grows and looks but wanted to see if the tradeoff of increased productivity was worth it. It's early days but felt fine with the small example. I'll try on a bigger project.
